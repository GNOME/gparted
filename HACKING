git guidelines for gparted
==========================

Please do not commit directly to the git.gnome.org/gparted repository
unless you have been given the green light to commit freely to
gparted.  When in doubt assume you haven't ;-).

If you are a translator feel free to mark strings for translation, fix
typos in the code, etc.  I'd appreciate it if you would notify me of
anything you've done.

Please send patches for build & configure fixes too.  I really appreciate
your help, I just want to review these fixes before applying.

!!WHENEVER YOU COMMIT, PLACE A COMMENT IN GIT!!
even when it's only one character. =)

Thanks,
Curtis



Coding style
============

The GParted code is all over the place in terms of coding style.  New
code, and updated code where reasonable, should use Allman style and
Smart Tabs alignment.  See src/OptionComboBox.cc and
src/SupportedFileSystems.cc as examples.  Don't worry too much about the
style, we can always adjust it if necessary during the review and merge
process.

Translatable files
==================

The file po/POTFILES.in lists all source files which do or could contain
translatable strings.  Remember to update when adding new and removing
old source code files include/*.h and src/*.cc.  Generally .cc files are
included and .h files are not, but there are exceptions.  Some mistakes
can be detected using:
    make distcheck
