CVS guidelines for gparted
========================

Please don't commit directly to the SVN unless you have been
given the green light to commit freely to gparted.  When in doubt
assume you haven't ;-). 

If you are a translator feel free to mark strings for translation,
fix typos in the code, etc. I'd appreciate it if you would notify me of anything you've done.

Please send patches for build & configure fixes too.  I really appreciate
your help, I just want to review these fixes before applying.

!!WHENEVER YOU COMMIT, PUT AN ENTRY IN THE APPROPIATE CHANGELOG!!
even when it's only one character. =)

Thanks,
Bart
